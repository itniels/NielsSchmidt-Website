<p>
    Hi, My name is Niels, I am a 33 year old developer from Denmark.<br />
    I have studied computer science at Business Academy Aarhus.
</p>
<h3>Software developer</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    I have a passion for programming and software development.<br />
    In 2012 I taught myself C# + Winforms during one year, and fell in love with the language and it’s possibilities, so I decided to quit my full time job and pursue a career within software development, by taking Computer Science as the first step. I am working hard in and outside of school learning different technologies, and building projects to learn.
    I am almost done with school (January 2017) and looking forward to getting back to working full time, and now in software development.
</p>
<h3>Me as a person</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    I am a very calm person, always smiling, happy and outgoing.<br />
    I love to sit and work on solutions that makes other peoples lives easier and better, and to create hapiness and positivity around me.
</p>
<h3>Family life</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    I have a wonderful and supportive fianceé who lives in the US.<br />
    We have been together for 2 years now, and she and I have 3 wonderful children from her previous marriage.<br />
</p>
<h3>My Story</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    I grew up on a pig farm in Sønderjylland Denmark<br/>
    I was always out helping in the fields and the stables ever since i could walk and reach the brake pedal in the tractor.<br/>
    Since then, I have had a lot of physically demanding jobs in production and warehousing after school, but I was always facinated by the computer and it's possiblities. So I decided
    to go back to school and take an education in IT, and that ended up being Computer Science, because I love to solve real problems and make things easier using code.
